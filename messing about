Messing about with photos in Topaz Studio

I couldn't resist working with some of the photos I took while away in France in Topaz Studio. The last time I was using Topaz I spent most of the time just working with Topaz impression because I am used to the effects I can get from it. I thought I should spend some time with Topaz Studio to try and get used to it. I found a lot of functionality I didn't know was there. I'm quite impressed with the masking possibilities available. I can mask each effect separately and it can get quite complicated. There are spot masks, gradient masks and I can also use a brush to get down to the dirty details. On my nice new iMac Topaz is working fast and the images are working extremely well. I definitely need to spend more time with the application to see what I can come up with. I'd like to send some of the images back to the iPad and work with them in Procreate, Metabrush and iColorama. I wouldn't mind getting some of the images printed onto canvas and put up around the house. I also have half a thought that I'd like to get some acrylic paints and go analogue painting some of the images onto canvas.

## It's not just about adding filters

What was in there before? Who knows?
It is complicated stuff

## What is creativity?

Creativity is all about making choices and decisions. You don't have to be stuck with whatever application gives you. Use one application to give a certain sort of effect, move into a different application in which you could manipulate by painting and drawing on the iPad with Apple Pencil. Then there's no reason at all why you could move it into a completely different application to do some finishing off. During the last couple days I have been working with Affinity Photo, Procreate, iColorama, Metabrush and Topaz Studio moving images in between them to get my artwork just the way I want it.
